# Instagram Clone

This project is a simplified Instagram clone built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Firebase used for authentication and database functionality.

## What I Built

- A responsive Instagram-style layout with a login and signup form.
- Firebase Authentication integration for user sign-up, login, and logout.
- Firestore integration to load and display posts in real-time.
- A feed that is only visible to logged-in users.
- Each post displays the user's profile photo, username, image, caption, and time since posted.
- Dynamic UI updates based on the userâ€™s login state (e.g. showing/hiding the feed, profile info, and auth form).

## Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Firebase Auth
- Firebase Firestore

## Notes

- Only authenticated users can view the feed and user sections.
- User profile info is dynamically loaded after login (email, profile picture).
- Posts are pulled in real-time from Firestore and update the feed automatically.
